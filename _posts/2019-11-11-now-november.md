_MFW my entire career depends on whether I can reverse a linked list in 20 minutes_

I'm currently in my first year at grad school in the states. My thoughts on grad
school are pretty mixed. I honestly didn't know what to expect coming into it,
but now it just feels like a full-time job juggling seemingly disjoint tasks
simultaneously. The worst of which has to be internship hunting. Anybody who's
been through this period knows how much of an absolute drain it is both on your
time that's spent practicing questions that serve as a proxy metric for job
success and your self-esteem when you begin doubting yourself when companies
don't respond to you.

I can get over the ghosting bit, I'm pretty pessimistic that way and usually
consider the worst outcome. Whiteboarding, on the other hand, involves what
essentially amounts to grinding through some 200+ questions on leetcode until
you've run out of questions which test for that _aha_ moment. Standardized
testing of any kind always runs the risk of people giving the exam to overfit
themselves to the testing pattern. Leetcode/ whiteboarding is no different. The
questions themselves aren't that difficult if encountered in a normal job
scenario, it's the added stress of having a tight time constraint and having
your future ride on whether you can validate a binary search tree that usually
gets me (and others I've heard.)

There isn't much substance to this rant because, at the end of the day, I can't
suggest other testing alternatives. Take-home projects are time-consuming for
both the interviewer and the interviewee, and it's also really hard to combat
cheating on take-home coding quizzes.

If you can't beat the system, then just keep grinding till you're better at it I
guess? It's a shitty system that just tests your willpower to get back in the
game again and again. But the nice thing about practicing leetcode questions is
that it's _quantifiable_. About a year ago I'd heard of this service called
Beeminder that tracks quantifiable goals of any kind, and it sets daily goals
based on some overarching high-level one. Here's the real kicker, if you miss a
particular goal/ deadline, it charges your credit card based on some preset
amount.

Here's my beeminder leetcode graph
