_Long mid-WFH walks_

I just finished my 3-month long internship with Amazon during the COVID pandemic
and it was quite the learning experience, both in terms of how Amazon itself
operates internally and what I’ve learned on how to work from home effectively.

Here’s the thing, I’ve worked from home before. I had this freelance gig right
before I started my master’s program, and it wasn’t all too fun. Syncing up over
the internet and being alone at home all day since my roommates were outside at
their physical workplaces didn’t really add up to an enjoyable experience.
Fast-forward to COIVD-19 and my dreams of living and working in Seattle come to
an abrupt halt. The first few weeks were weird because it’s terribly difficult
to keep yourself accountable when no one is watching. It’s difficult to motivate
yourself to work too when your bed is right next to you and there isn’t a single
co-worker in sight – the environment just wasn’t right.

But over time, as the work slowly poured in, it sort of just became a way of
life. I was practically either working or thinking about work all the time. To
be fair I didn’t have much of a ‘life’ in this ‘work-life balance’ most people
speak of because I was stuck at home in lockdown, and I don’t own a car and live
in the 'burbs. But this didn’t really bother me anyway. I gave it my all and it
was a very rewarding experience except for a few crunch days I had near the end
of my internship just before launching my feature. I’ll be honest, even though
it’s only been 2 days since my last day of work, I’ve been experiencing a weird
feeling of withdrawal, I feel like there isn’t that much to do anymore. I guess
it just goes to show how adaptable humans can be.

I’ve got a few weeks to go before classes begin again. I plan on using the time
to familiarize myself with a few frameworks and languages I became acquainted
with while interning. These are:

1. SpringMVC
2. Testing frameworks (Mockito/EasyMock/PowerMock)
3. Ruby
