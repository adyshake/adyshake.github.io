title: Improving Network Latency
description: No ms for this mf

My friends and I recently got into this new game
[Valorant](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/). It's a great game but the only
thing holding us back from having an enjoyable experience was our latencies
since we live on opposite sides of the planet. To mediate our latencies, we
usually settle for a middle ground and that always happens to be European
servers and although my average ping hovered around 140 ms, it wasn't very
consistent. Random ping spikes would ruin clutch moments. It bothered me enough
to finally route a LAN cable around my house and see what sort of a difference
it would make and wow did it make a difference. You can find some of the
differences in latencies and speeds for 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and LAN below. Your
mileage may definitely vary with regards to switching to a wired solution since
factors like crowded frequency spectrums, range, and periodic network scanning
determine how bad your WiFi experience can be.
