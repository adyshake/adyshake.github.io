And just like that I wrapped up my master's program earlier this year and I've
moved to Seattle for good now. It's a great city--it certainly beats what Dallas
had to offer. I've also started working at Amazon this summer. I've matched with
a great team and the work's hard but it's fulfilling. I've been here for about 2
months now and I feel incredibly lucky to have been able to meet so many people
because I know how difficult it is to make friends in a new city as a busy
adult. I'm just grateful for a lot of things in life right now and I'd like to
keep this update short. Till next time.

This page is a public declaration of my priorities and a reminder to myself for
times when I’m feeling unfocused. It was inspired by Thomas Frank’s impossible
list and Derek Sivers’ now page.
