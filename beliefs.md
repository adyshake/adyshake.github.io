Beliefs
======

## Behavior is hard to fix
Most people underestimate how much of their behavior is a direct result of
emotions that will return when faced with similar circumstances.

## The world rewards scarcity and not effort
This is simply a product of supply and demand. Hard work will not matter much if
the barrier to entry to a particular field of work is very low.

## A persons version of the truth is subjective and limited to how he constructs his reality
Henry Luce once said, "Show me a man who thinks he's objective and I'll show
you a man who's deceiving himself".

## It's easier to spot other's mistakes than your own
While judging ourselves, it's very easy to delude ourselves and rationalize our
bad behaviors and actions.

## Network effects drive your entire life
What family you're born into, what school you go to, who you marry is all
dictated by layers of network effects that drive decision making since it's what
responsible for putting options in front of you.
