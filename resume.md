  CloudFront. This decoupled frontend allowed our team to launch our product
  more effectively in multiple marketplaces.
* Set up a continuous integration/deployment solution on AWS using CDK,
  CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodePipeline, and Lambda along with metrics to track
  API usage and alarm on-calls in case of excessive errors.
